Individual Website
==================


It is my first time to design a static website

I learned a lot from *kenliao94* and *marcokstephen*. 

By practising HTML5, CSS, Javascript and studying documentation of JQuery and bootstrap library, I finally be able to write a decent personal website.

I also want to express my appreciation to **W3School**, it's a great source for learning web programming. And *tryityourself* function is the best
